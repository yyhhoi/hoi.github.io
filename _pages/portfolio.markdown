Human thinking process is inherently dual in nature: One is "local/actual", and the another is "remote/virtual". Like while we are chopping an onion, we also mind-wander and think about what if we don't make a soup today? Or even buying a house in the future.

To model such a memory function, we **developed a mathematical framework** and **simulated a biological neural network**. We applied methods such as **predictive classifiers**, **time-series analysis** and **parameter estimation** on the simulated neural data to prove our hypothesis.. We demonstrated that neuron populations can support such dual coding and published our results in highly-recognized scientific journal [*eLife*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/86837).
