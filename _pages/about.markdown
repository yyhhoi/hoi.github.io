Hey there! I'm a Ph.D. graduate from the University of Munich and Freiburg, where I developed neuro-inspired learning algorithms combined with reinforcement learning for wheeled robots. Before diving into this exciting Ph.D. journey, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree, focusing on deep learning, computer vision, representational learning, and generative models for two intensive years.

My academic adventure started with a background in Biomedical Engineering, where I specialized in bio-sensors. This unique blend of experiences has given me a diverse skill set and a passion for innovative technology.

When I'm not immersed in the world of AI and Data Sciences, you'll find me exploring the Alps, hiking, and climbing to my heart's content.
